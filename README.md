# ECE3574-Text-to-HTML-in-GUI
A GUI where you type in a text box and have it converted to HTML real-time


I created a GUI where you could type in a text editor on the left side and in real time the right side would convert everything 
into an html script. 
It allows adding bold, italic, and headers.
